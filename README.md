Clockwise
=========

[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jonsequitur/Clockwise?svg=true&branch=master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jonsequitur/Clockwise) [![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Clockwise.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Clockwise/) 

Clockwise is a lightweight command dispatcher, scheduler, and handler library. It has a particular focus on testability. Clockwise approaches the pain of testing message-based systems by providing in-memory scheduling and clock-jumping features, as well as support for retries and idempotency. These in-memory implementations can be used as functionally equivalent test doubles to the storage-backed implementations.
