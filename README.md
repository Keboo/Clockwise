Clockwise is a lightweight command dispatcher, scheduler, and handler library. It has a particular focus on testability. Clockwise approaches the pain of testing message-based systems by providing in-memory scheduling and clock-jumping features, as well as support for retries and idempotency. These in-memory implementations can be used as functionally equivalent substitutes to the storage-backed implementations.
